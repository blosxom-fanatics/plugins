# Documentation: See the bottom of this file or type: perldoc wbnotify
# Requirements: writebacks -plugin and a sendmail compatible mailer (most on
#               unixen). On Windows, you can use 'Blat', a command-line
#               mailer. You can find it here: http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/blat.html
#               (on windows you'll also have to modify the sendmail variable!)

package writebacknotify;
use strict;

# --- Configurable variables -----

# Address that writebacks will be mailed to.
# *** This plugin will not action until you set it. ***
my $wbaddr = 'david@kineticode.com';

# Location of sendmail -executable. If default doesn't work, try to find the
# right location and replace this variable with it.
# This may help you find something suitable:
# for i in `locate sendmail`; do if [ -x $i ]; then echo $i; fi; done;
my $sendmail = "/usr/sbin/sendmail";

# --------------------------------

use CGI qw/:standard/;

sub start {
    # Only spring into action if POSTing to the writeback plug-in
    return 1 unless $writeback::success;

    if (open my $mail, "| $sendmail -t") {
        my $name  = param('name');
        my $url   = param('url');
        my $title = param('title');
        my $body  = param('comment') || param('excerpt');
